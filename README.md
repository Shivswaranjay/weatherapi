# weatherapi

In this project, I created a website with the help of OpenWeatherMap API and Rapid API. We got the basic knowledge of creating a basic weather app for users and it will help them to search for Weather in any place easily. 
This is useful for the users to get real-time reports/conditions of the weather for a particular city so that they can plan things accordingly.
Applications with live data APIs can provide up-to-date information so that it becomes user-
friendly. Not only the current weather report but also the prediction of the next 7 days makes it
more useful from the user’s point of view.
By using two different API’S in one website it becomes more user-friendly because the user can
easily compare more than API for knowing the weather report/conditions.
